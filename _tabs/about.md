> **Fadongkwon Soft** is a business established by a Korean S/W engineer father with the goal of creating and launching two apps per month to leave a digital legacy for his two children.

## WHY Fadongkwon?
> - My children's first name is 류O(Ryu OOO).
> - In my childhood, I enjoyed playing the Street Fighter arcade game, which features a character named Ryu.
> - One of Ryu's iconic moves, where he shoots an energy wave, is called 'Hadouken' in Japanese, but it's referred to as '파동권(Padongkwon)' in Korean.
> - Since I am their father, I could have left the 'Pa' as it is, but I modified it to 'Fa' to also signify family.
> - And that's how the name 'Fadongkwon' was born.

## LOGO
> The letter 'F' in Fadongkwon was designed by combining the joystick motion sequence used to execute a move in the game with the shape of the energy wave.
